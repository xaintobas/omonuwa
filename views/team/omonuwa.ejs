              Dr. G. I. S. Omonuwa was the foundational pillar and guiding
              spirit of our firm. A man of immense intellect and integrity, his
              distinguished career spanned public service, academia, and private
              legal practice, leaving an indelible mark on every field he
              touched.

              After being called to the Nigerian Bar in 1964, he began his
              career as a State Counsel in the Federal Ministry of Justice
              before dedicating several years to shaping the next generation of
              lawyers as an Associate Professor at the Nigerian Law School. In
              1984, he retired into private practice, establishing the firm that
              proudly bears his name and continues to uphold his values of
              diligence and excellence.
