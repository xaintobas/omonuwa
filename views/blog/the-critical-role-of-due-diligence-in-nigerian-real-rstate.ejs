            The Critical Role of Due Diligence in Nigerian Real Estate
            Transactions
          </h2>
          <div class="blog-detail-text-box">
            <p>
              Investment in real estate remains one of the most reliable paths
              to wealth creation in Nigeria. However, the path to acquiring
              secure and profitable property is fraught with potential pitfalls.
              Issues ranging from defective titles and fraudulent sellers to
              unresolved family disputes and government acquisition notices can
              turn a promising investment into a protracted legal nightmare.
            </p>
            <p>
              The single most effective shield against these risks is a robust
              and meticulous legal due diligence process. Before any funds are
              committed or contracts signed, a prospective buyer must look
              beyond the physical structure and investigate the legal health of
              the property. This is not a mere formality; it is a fundamental
              investigation that verifies ownership, uncovers liabilities, and
              ultimately ensures that the buyer acquires a clean, unencumbered,
              and legally defensible title.

                In Nigerian real estate, the land itself is only half the asset.
                The other half is a clean, undisputed title. The former is
                purchased with money; the latter is secured with diligence.

              An effective due diligence exercise involves several key steps. It
              begins with a comprehensive search at the relevant Land Registry
              to confirm the registered owner and check for encumbrances such as
              mortgages or liens. This is followed by a physical inspection to
              verify boundaries against survey plans and to check for any
              adverse occupants or competing claims. Additionally, inquiries at
              state and local government planning offices are necessary to
              ensure compliance with zoning regulations. At O. A. Omonuwa SAN &
              Co., we undertake this exhaustive process on behalf of our
              clients, providing them with the clarity and security needed to
              proceed with confidence in their real estate transactions.
